# About me

## I'm Shannon, a Project Manager working hybrid supporting the Transform to Open Science (TOPS) Project Office, a NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Initiative, based out of Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

- ðŸ”­ I've spent the past 9+ years working across different areas of Information Technology (IT) management: managing Information Technology (IT) projects in the Workplace Collaboration Services (WCS) portfolio using standard Project Management (PM) practices: managing schedule, cost, scope, and assessing risk; SharePoint Administration; IT Security ISSO; IT Property Management; contract team lead, etc.  In all aspects, my job has involved: managing and solving issues from both a technical and strategic view; seeking and demonstratating a fundamental understanding of technical capabilities and customer needs; exploring and implementing new technologies to enhance products and services.  I am skilled at identifing key stakeholders and working with customers to prioritize and baseline projects each fiscal year and to baseline requirements and subsequent milestones at a customer board or panel, this involves providing technical advice to customers on a wide range of IT project issues.
I enjoy working as a technical liaison between customers, contractors, and business office management to develop integrated products and achieve consensus and buy-in during all phases of the project life-cycle to support the overall mission.

- ðŸŒ± These days my time is spent researching, designing, coding and keeping up wih the ever-evolving IT landscape.

- ðŸ›¶ Out of the office you may find me working on my fixer-upper house, playing on the water (kayaking), or exploring a random trail on foot/in the Jeep.
